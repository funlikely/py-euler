    Pandigital Fibonacci Ends

    Problem 104

    Let F be the Fibonnacci sequence, F1 = 1, F2 = 1, F3 = 2, .., so that F = 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, . . .

    It turns out that F541 which contains 113 digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the last nine digits
    are 1-9 pandigital (contain all the digits 1-9, but not necessarily in order). And F2749, which contains 575
    digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits are 1-9 pandigital.

    Given that Fk
    is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits AND the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital, find k.
