    Square Root Convergents
    Problem 57

    sqrt(2) = 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + ...)))

    Fractions in the partial series are

    3/2, 7/5, 17/12, 41/29, 99/70, 239/169, 577/408, 1393/985, ...

    1393/985 is the first example where the number of digits in the numerator exceeds the number of digits in the
    denoninator.

    In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a numerator with more digits than the denominator?
