    Problem 60

    The primes $3$, $7$, $109$, and $673$, are quite remarkable. By taking any two primes and concatenating them in
    any order the result will always be prime. For example, taking $7$ and $109$, both $7109$ and $1097$ are prime.
    The sum of these four primes, $792$, represents the lowest sum for a set of four primes with this property.</p>
    <p>Find the lowest sum for a set of five primes for which any two primes concatenate to produce another prime.
